# SkillSwap

**SkillSwap** is a collaborative mobile application that enables users to exchange skills without using money. Whether you're fluent in Spanish, great at graphic design, or know how to fix bikes, the app helps you connect with others looking for what you offer — and offering what you need. It’s a peer-to-peer system that values learning and mutual support over financial transactions.

### The Problem

Many people have valuable skills but lack the means or platform to share and trade them. Traditional paid services can be inaccessible or impersonal, and informal exchanges are hard to organize and sustain.

### The Solution

**SkillSwap** turns your skills into currency. By allowing people to request and offer help directly, it creates a flexible, trust-based system where users collaborate, learn, and grow together — without needing to spend money. It’s the sharing economy, applied to knowledge and abilities.
